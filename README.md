# Does It Bechdel?

This is the client-side single page application that connects to a [Ruby API](https://github.com/tsengsational/does-it-bechdel-api). Does It Bechdel is a data visualization tool that exposes sexism in Hollywood by using a dataset from FiveThirtyEight of over 1,700 movies. I used the Open Movie Database (OMdB) to expand the information in the data set by associating actors and directors with the films.

This front-end application is built with React and styled with Bootstrap.

The main feature of this design is a background video. You can read about how I implemented it [here](https://medium.com/undefined-methods/i-will-video-cover-you-462e13f8ef76).
